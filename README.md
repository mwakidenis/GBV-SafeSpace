## 🌟 Overview

**HERA SafeSpace** is a comprehensive digital safety platform specifically designed for women and girls across Africa, with special focus on communities in Kenya and surrounding regions. The platform combines cutting-edge AI technology with culturally-sensitive support systems to create a safe space for learning, reporting, and community support.

### 🌍 The Problem We are Solving

**Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Statistics in Africa:**
Gender-Based Violence refers to harmful acts directed at an individual based on their gender. It includes physical, emotional, sexual, and economic abuse, and remains one of the most widespread human rights violations globally. GBV affects people of all genders, but disproportionately impacts women and girls. Raising awareness, promoting prevention, and supporting survivors are essential steps toward building safer and more equitable communities.
- 1 in 3 women worldwide experience physical or sexual violence
- In Kenya, 45% of women aged 15-49 have experienced physical violence
- Only 40% of women who experience violence seek help
- Digital harassment and cyberbullying affect 73% of women online

HERA SafeSpace addresses these critical challenges by providing a safe, accessible, and culturally-sensitive digital platform.

### 🎯 Mission

To provide accessible, secure, and culturally-aware digital tools that empower women and girls to:
- **Detect** harmful content and online threats using AI
- **Document** incidents securely with military-grade encryption
- **Learn** digital safety skills through interactive lessons
- **Connect** with support networks and verified resources
- **Support** each other through anonymous community forums

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Git** for version control

   ```
   
   Then edit `.env` with your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```
   
   > **Note for Lovable deployments:** These values are automatically injected when you connect Supabase through the Lovable dashboard. If authentication isn't working, try reconnecting your Supabase project in the Lovable settings.
